Khushi Parikh - MetroHacks EmpowHER 2021 Application (Protein Design for Alzheimer's Disease)
3 Programs:
Protein_Folding: native conformation of an unfolded backbone is identified through manipulations which maxime hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions
Protein_Packing: Monte Carlo simulated annealing is applied to substitute rotamers for original residues and output the lowest-energy configuration
Protein_Docking: protein orientations are sampled to maximize protein-protein interactions between the de novo substrate and the Aβ peptide
Output of the three successive programs is a de novo protein which binds Aβ peptide and marks the complex for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Outputs of one program are the inputs of the next program.
